1. Download the tool from https://github.com/berylc/MendelianRNA-seq and set up its runtime environment.
2. For each tissue type, get a list of chromosomes which contain DNA regions listed in ROH, and sort and index the bam files of all samples (cases and GTEx).
3. Follow the instructions (and example) to generate junction file using the annotation data located under the annotation subdirectory and gene list located under the gene_list subdirectory.
4. Follow the instructions (and example), normalize the splicing junction scores.  Place the normalized scores in ./results.
5  Configure run_cummings.sh and run it for each case.
