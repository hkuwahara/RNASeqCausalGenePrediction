1. Generate gene-level count data of samples  (from both cases and GTEx) and combine them into tables based on their tissue types (fibroblast-derived and LCL-derived ones), with columns representing samples and rows representing genes.  Note that the gene-level count data must be rounded to the nearest integer.  The GTEx samples from each tissue type that were used in this comparative study are listed in files under comparative_study/data.  

2. Configure run_outrider.R to correctly set the paths for the tables and results.

3. Run run_outrider.R

4. Extract genes based on the position-filtered gene list for each case.
